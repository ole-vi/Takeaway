# Takeout

Takeout is the Android port of the Planet web application. It will work with Planet like Take Home works with BeLL.

### Current Features

### Getting started

#### For Users
 
On your Android device, go to [Releases](https://github.com/ole-vi/takeout/releases/tag/latest) and download the latest version of the APK of the Application. Click on the downloaded APK and choose `install`.

#### For Interns

Virtual Interns who will be working on the project should start out by setting up the repository on their own device in Android Studio. The steps are very similar to the process followed for cloning the [open-learning-exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io) repository. The only difference is that you **do not need to fork** the takeout repository as you are now a part of the team. 

Open the takeout repository on Android Studio. Click on `Build` to sync and build the project. If you face any issues in syncing or compiling the project, use the [mobile gitter channel](https://gitter.im/open-learning-exchange/mobile) or the Mobile Hacking Hangout to discuss and solve your difficulties with the team.

> We also encourage you add the solutions to any syncing or compiling issues to this README document in the Troubleshooting section as a guidance to the future virtual interns.
